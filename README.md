# Bash scripts
A (very) few `bash` and `zsh` scripts, some of which haven't been used for a while so may not be fit for purpose.

* `pdf-combine` takes one argument, and combines all PDFs in the directory where it is run into a single file with that name, using `pdftk`.

* `csv2latex` is a find and replace script which turns csv files into LaTeX markup.

* ``pdfcroplatex` takes a`.tex` file as an argument, then compiles it and crops the results using `pdfcrop`. Good for making diagrams. Not tested for a while.

* `purgelatex` deletes everything LaTeX-related except for `.tex` files.
